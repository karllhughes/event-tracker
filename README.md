Event Tracker
==============================================

A simple Rails application to track and organize events that I might want to attend. I built this simply to dive back into Ruby on Rails. 


## Application Setup

### Tech requirements

- Ruby 2.3+
- Rails 5.0+
- Sqlite 3.14+

### Local setup

1. Clone this repo locally.

2. Run `bundle install` to get the dependencies installed.

3. Run database migrations: `rails db:migrate`.

4. (Optional) Seed the database with some dummy data: `rails db:seed`.

5. Run `rails server`. The app should be running on `localhost:3000`.
